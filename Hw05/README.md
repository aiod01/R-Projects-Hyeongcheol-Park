### To report my process.

  As a non-native Eng listener and reader, I cannot say that the assignment is easy. 
I read all the materials on stat545 webpage by myself and tried everything which took many hours. Sometimes it was hard to understand what it says.
When I got stuck, I go all around near my office and grap anyone and asked. The homework was time consuming but very worthy.
 
  I am glad that I finished this assignment on time.
