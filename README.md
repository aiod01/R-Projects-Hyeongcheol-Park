**About HW03**

##To report my process.


 It was so hard to upload my homework to Github repository!!!!
 I tried to arrange things so I made folders in my local computer for hw2 and hw3, and I moved files in my local computer to each folder. That made huge messy!!!!!
 I was totally broken down to fix the problem.
 
  Anyway, I cloned my github address and made a new repository again and somewhat fixed my problem, at least it seems like that.
 Hope I am doing well, I am afraid of the messy left in my local computer.

 

 one of the difficults thing was that I would like to make a chart of "how many countries people die early" without overlapping same years five times for each continent. I tried to do it but I gave up to find the solution. 
 
 
  And It seems that I am getting use to using %>% function. It was not fully free for me to analize whatever I want to try, but I think I am getting better for that.
  However, honestly, I still don't know well how to decorate plots  changing axis, scale, and so on. So I skipped many of that in my assignment3.
  
  
  Helpful tutorial was absolutely the lecture note, [here](https://stat545.com/cm007-notes_and_exercises.html). And I searched some [blog](http://www.dodomira.com/2016/03/18/ggplot2-기초/), which was more readable for me, while I don't think it will be helpful to others.




 **About HW02**

* Easy

basic plotting was easy and fun! especially when I was analyzing gdp and population after 2000year, I could see the world in a chart.

 And it was also easy and interesting to see my country data with many plots. I hope I have enough time to do more of it.


* Difficulties


 [This is my gapminder exploration ](https://github.com/aiod01/STAT545-hw02-Hyeongcheol-Park/blob/master/Exploring_Gapminder_for_HW2.md). It was hard to make a plot with two graphs. I wanted to compare GDP and population between Korea and the other countries, which takes a while. I solved it to ask my friend which leads her google it.
 
 To be honest, I forgot many things from lectrue so I had to read all of the texts on [the website](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html).

 And I couldn't figure out how to write something in the middle and right side of graph, saying Green: others or Blue: Korea. So I jsut put it in subtitle area.
 
  It took some time to use pipping as well. It is not a difficult problem, but for me it was little bit hard as I was in hurry.
