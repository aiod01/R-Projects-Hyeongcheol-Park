 **About HW02**

* Easy

basic plotting was easy and fun! especially when I was analyzing gdp and population after 2000year, I could see the world in a chart.

 And it was also easy and interesting to see my country data with many plots. I hope I have enough time to do more of it.


* Difficulties


 [This is my gapminder exploration ](https://github.com/aiod01/STAT545-hw02-Hyeongcheol-Park/blob/master/Exploring_Gapminder_for_HW2.md). It was hard to make a plot with two graphs. I wanted to compare GDP and population between Korea and the other countries, which takes a while. I solved it to ask my friend which leads her google it.
 
 To be honest, I forgot many things from lectrue so I had to read all of the texts on [the website](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html).

 And I couldn't figure out how to write something in the middle and right side of graph, saying Green: others or Blue: Korea. So I jsut put it in subtitle area.
 
  It took some time to use pipping as well. It is not a difficult problem, but for me it was little bit hard as I was in hurry.
