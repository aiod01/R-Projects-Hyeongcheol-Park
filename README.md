##Welcome everyone

# for assignment!

1. I got the changes by my local computer, using R studio into README.md. I refered the [website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/hw01_sample_readme.md) to revise this file.
 
2. About my GitHub workflow and my experience with Markdown, I read all the explains from stat545 website because I couldn't follow last thursday's lecture. 

3. The explain on the website was easy to follow. I was little bit confused of editing readme at the first time to be honest, but it feels much better now after trying several stuffs by myself.

    - putting image was difficult, in somehow, it didn't work.
    - it seems that "space" is important, if not, the codes didn't work.

4. R Markdown and exploring gapmider was easy, and fun!
