**About HW03**




 It was so hard to upload my homework to Github repository!!!!
 I tried to arrange things so I made folders in my local computer for hw2 and hw3, and I moved files in my local computer to each folder. That made huge messy!!!!!
 I was totally broken down to fix the problem.
 
  Anyway, I cloned my github address and made a new repository again and somewhat fixed my problem, at least it seems like that.
 Hope I am doing well, I am afraid of the messy left in my local computer.

 

 one of the difficults thing was that I would like to make a chart of "how many countries people die early" without overlapping same years five times for each continent. I tried to do it but I gave up to find the solution. 
 
 
  And It seems that I am getting use to using %>% function. It was not fully free for me to analize whatever I want to try, but I think I am getting better for that.
  However, honestly, I still don't know well how to decorate plots  changing axis, scale, and so on. So I skipped many of that in my assignment3.
  
  
  Helpful tutorial was absolutely the lecture note, [here](https://stat545.com/cm007-notes_and_exercises.html). And I searched some [blog](http://www.dodomira.com/2016/03/18/ggplot2-기초/), which was more readable for me, while I don't think it will be helpful to others.

my peer review was helpful! here it comes HeatherSummer's homework2 [HeatherSummers](https://github.com/heathersummers/STAT545-hw-Summers-Heather/blob/master/hw02/hw02.md)






It was hard, there was some Rmd error that makes me feel dizzy.
I figured out I need to refer r markdown cheat sheet still.

 And there was some error on my r codes. And because of my bad examples of complementary dataframe for gapminder, I need to make 2 tables.
 
  gather and spread was easy to follow.

  I put links that I looked at on my .md file, too.
